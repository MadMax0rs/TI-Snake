# This is for the TI-84 Plus CE Python

## Notes
- I don't really know how licences work so if you want to use my code, just please credit me somewhere.
- If you have any questions or feedback on how I format this repo or any of my code, your comment would be greatly appreciated!

# Download instructions:

1. You will need a program on your calculator to run asm code, I prefer [arTIfiCE](https://github.com/MadMax0rs/TI-84-Plus-CE-Python-Jailbreak)
2. Download the latest .zip file and extract it into a folder
	- There should be 2 files, SNAKE.8xp, and SNKSKNDF.8xv (supposed to stand for SNAKE_SKIN_DEFAULT).
3. Upload both files to your calculator through TI-Connect CE
4. Launch the game through arTIfiCE
5. Use \[_clear_\] to close the game
